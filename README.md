# Bayesian hierarchical modeling for COVID-19

Contributors: Benjamin Levy (Harvard University), Aditya Ranganathan (Harvard University)

With this project we want to try to answer some of the following questions about COVID-19

* Given the number of reported cases, what is the true rate of COVID-19 in my country/community?
* How well is my country doing in containing the spread of COVID-19 vis-a-vis other countries in the world?
* How much longer should I expect the pandemic to continue?

We iteratively construct a Bayesian hierarchical model using data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) on daily cases of COVID-19 around the world and from Our World In Data on testing rates. Other data sources will be added as needed.
